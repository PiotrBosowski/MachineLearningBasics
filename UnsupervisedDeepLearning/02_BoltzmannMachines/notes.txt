Boltzmann Machines arent directional - connections between nodes (neurons) are 2 ways

deterministic/stochastic

Boltzmann Machine allows to create a working model with limited data and then it recognize aberrative models

Energy-Based Models - things (systems) are always trying to reach the state of lowest possible energy (you throw a stone - it falls, you heat it up - it cools down); the higher energy, the lower probability

Restricted Boltzmann Machine - hidden nodes arent connected with each other, same with visible nodes

Contrastive
