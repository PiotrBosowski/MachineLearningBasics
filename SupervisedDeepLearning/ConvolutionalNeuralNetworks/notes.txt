Step 1. Convolution Operation
convolution is a process of applying filter (feature detectors) to the image in order to find certain features
as a result weve got a set of feature maps

Step 2. ReLU Layer

Step 3. Max Pooling (downsampling)
reducing the size of feature map by transforming it into pooled feature map, which contain less data about lack of feature
splts feature map into f.e. 2x2 squares and takes max (Max Pooling) value (high value - feature detected), then combines those max values into pooled feature map

Step 4. Flattening
transforming 2d into 1d array

Step 5. Full Connection
in CNN we use fully connected hidden layers
during back propagation not only synapses weight are being optimized, but also feature matrices
